Crop Recommendation and Classification

This repository contains a Python code implementation for crop recommendation and classification based on various environmental factors. The code utilizes machine learning algorithms and data visualization techniques to analyze a dataset and make predictions regarding suitable crops for specific conditions.

The code begins by importing necessary libraries, including seaborn, matplotlib, and pandas, to handle data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. It then loads a dataset called 'Crop_recommendation.csv', which contains information about different crops and their corresponding environmental parameters such as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to gain insights into the dataset. The code uses seaborn to create a heatmap to visualize any missing values in the dataset, ensuring data quality. Additionally, it generates various distribution plots, count plots, pair plots, and joint plots to explore the distribution and relationships between different features, enabling a better understanding of the data.

To prepare the dataset for machine learning, categorical labels are converted into numerical values using the 'label' column, and feature scaling is applied using MinMaxScaler to normalize the feature values. The processed dataset is then split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.

The code proceeds to implement two classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). For KNN, the code utilizes the KNeighborsClassifier from scikit-learn, varying the number of neighbors to find the optimal value that yields the highest accuracy. The accuracy of the KNN model is evaluated using the score function and a confusion matrix is generated to visualize the performance of the model.

For SVM, the code applies three different kernels: linear, radial basis function (RBF), and polynomial. The accuracy of each SVM model is evaluated and printed to compare their performance.

Furthermore, the code demonstrates the use of GridSearchCV from scikit-learn to perform hyperparameter tuning on the linear kernel SVM model. It searches for the optimal combination of hyperparameters (C and gamma) using a grid of values and cross-validation, resulting in an improved model.

Additionally, a Decision Tree Classifier and a Random Forest Classifier are implemented to compare their performance. The accuracy scores of these models on both the training and testing sets are printed, and a bar plot is generated to visualize the feature importance for the Decision Tree Classifier.

Lastly, the code employs a Gradient Boosting Classifier to further enhance the prediction accuracy. The accuracy score of the Gradient Boosting model on the test set is printed.

Throughout the code, data visualization plays a crucial role in providing insights and evaluating model performance. Seaborn and matplotlib are used to create visualizations such as classification reports, bar plots, and heatmaps.

This project aims to help farmers and agricultural practitioners make informed decisions by recommending suitable crops based on environmental parameters. It serves as a practical example of how machine learning algorithms can be utilized to assist in crop planning and decision-making processes.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to adapt it to your specific requirements or dataset. Happy crop recommendation and classification!
